### New features

- Add `/fastapi-bootcamp/astroplan` router with a basic API for observational sites and computing the observability of targets from those sites. This API is build around [astroplan](https://astroplan.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). We're including it in this app to demonstrate the service architecture that we prefer in SQuaRE, where the application's domain is isolated from concerns of the web API and even storage and other types of external adapters.
